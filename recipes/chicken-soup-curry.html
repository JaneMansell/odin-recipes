    <h2>Description</h2>
    A simple recipe from Reade Grandma that makes a chicken curry baked in the oven for at least 90 minutes.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 raw chicken pieces</li>
        <li>2 cans of Heinz cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>3-5 teasp Madras curry paste (depending how spicy you want it to be)</li>
        <li>25g basmati rice per person</li>
        <li>100g frozen peas</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the oven on 180 degrees</li>
        <li>If the chicken pieces have skin on them, fry them first, skin down. Just enough to brown the skin.</li>
        <li>Heat the Madras paste in a pan on the hob</li>
        <li>Add the soup and heat until starting to bubble</li>
        <li>Transfer to an oven proof casserole dish and add the chicken pieces</li>
        <li>Put in oven and cook for 2 hours (90 minutes if no bones in chicken)</li>
        <li>Towards the end of the curry cooking, boil the rice and peas.</li>
        <li>Serve as a ring of rice and peas mixed together and curry in the middle as it is quite a runny curry</li>
